//Write a function `canConstruct(target, wordbank)` that accepts a target string and an array of strings.

//The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not the `target` can be constructed by concatenating
    //elemends of the `wordbank` array.

//You may reuse the elements of the `wordbank` as many times as needed
